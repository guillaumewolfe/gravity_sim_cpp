    story = "\tFormed 4.6 billion years ago, the Sun, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, fuels itself through nuclear fusion. Spanning 109 Earth diameters, it holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass. In about 5 billion years, as it exhausts its hydrogen, the Sun will become a red giant, potentially swallowing Earth. It'll then form a planetary nebula, leaving a cooling white dwarf, its final state over the next trillions of years.";
